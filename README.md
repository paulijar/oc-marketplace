A backend-free replacement for marketplace.owncloud.com. Publishers submit apps
via pull request; CI validates each submission; a static website and a JSON API
are generated from the catalog and hosted on GitHub Pages. There is no server and
no database — the Git repository itself is the source of truth.

## Getting Started

This repository contains two independent npm packages: `tools/` (the TypeScript
validator and API generator) and `website/` (the Astro site). Each is installed
and built on its own.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc))
- npm
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) (app tarballs are stored via LFS)

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/marketplace.git
cd marketplace

# Validator + API generator
cd tools
npm install
npm test
npm run typecheck

# Static website
cd ../website
npm install
npm run build
```

### Repository Structure

- **apps/** — the catalog and source of truth (one folder per app/release):
  `apps/<app-id>/releases/<version>/package.tar.gz`. Metadata is read from the
  `appinfo/info.xml` inside each tarball.
- **tools/** — TypeScript validator and API generator (run with `tsx`, tested
  with Vitest). See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md).
- **website/** — Astro static site that renders the catalog.
- **.github/** — CI workflows, the publish-app pull request template, and
  Dependabot configuration.

## Publishing an App

Open a pull request that adds a single file:

```
apps/<app-id>/releases/<version>/package.tar.gz
```

All metadata is read from the `appinfo/info.xml` inside the tarball. Optionally
add a `CHANGELOG.md` next to it. CI validates the submission; once merged to
`main`, the catalog, API and website are regenerated and deployed automatically.
See the pull request template for the full checklist.

## Generated API

Served as static JSON from GitHub Pages:

- `GET /api/v1/categories.json`
- `GET /api/v1/apps.json` — full catalog
- `GET /api/v1/platform/{ocVersion}/apps.json` — back-compat with the `market` app
- `GET /api/v1/bundles.json`

## Documentation

- Publishing workflow and catalog layout — this README and the
  [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
- Validator and API generator internals — [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md)
